# Welcome

This page or project whatever will it be is made for school project showcasing different markdown syntaxes.

## List of things I'll be testing

1. Tables
2. Links
3. Fenced Code Block
4. Task List
5. Basic Syntax elements for better looking text

### Let's start with the table

| A&B | A | B |
|----|---|----|
| A | AA | AB |
| B | BB | BB |

This table is just an ~~bad~~ example, but still a table.

### Linking links

Making links is quite simple. Just make `[title](website link)`, where Title can be *anything*, but should have context and in the `()` symbols you paste the link.

Here are few links to popular websites.

### Fenced Code Block
I am not sure, if it's actually called this, but I found the term from [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

Basically you can display your code in Markdown documents.

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
How neat is that?

	Neat
    : arranged in a tidy way; in a good order
    : done with or demostrating skill or efficiency

Ok what's next...
- [x] Tables and links
- [x] Fenced Code Block
- [ ] Task list
- [ ] Something smart

Oh right, task list. :pensive:

### Task List

Task list is simple to make and can be used in many ways.
Like shopping lists, to-do lists and study notes.

**This is how I made the _task list_ earlier**

### Here is a bunch of text effects and stuff

**Lorem ipsum** dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Donec fringilla felis sit amet elit egestas, eu finibus lectus elementum. Proin venenatis finibus nunc semper placerat. Ut tincidunt finibus lacus sed imperdiet. _Sed gravida rhoncus sodales. Nulla in venenatis arcu, eu aliquet neque. Phasellus sodales leo nec justo tristique imperdiet_.
> Quisque rutrum gravida massa non accumsan.

1.Aenean finibus tempor dolor et sagittis. 
- Nulla aliquam tincidunt purus sed facilisis.
  - Integer maximus mauris turpis. Nulla molestie tempus tortor, vel malesuada sapien.

Morbi in neque urna. Quisque at auctor sem[^1]. ~~Aliquam vitae elementum massa~~, et suscipit dui[^2]. Mauris eu efficitur purus, ac suscipit arcu. Nam tincidunt consectetur lectus, commodo viverra quam condimentum vitae.:+1:
This text uses <sub>subscript</sub> and this text uses <sup>superscript</sup> for an example.

[^1]: Example of footnote.

[^2]: Second example of footnote.

Hopefully this is covers most of the stuff.
